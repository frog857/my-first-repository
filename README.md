# Read me! #

So this is my first repo. I created some bs last time, but it never went anywhere. This time, I'm really hoping to commit to my coding journey. I want to do it daily. For just a few hours. I don't want to announce it to friends, or tell everyone I'm on my way to land a 6 figure job. I want to do this daily. Slowly develop a passion and a skill for it. And set myself up for lifelong learning and work.

Mission: to create useful tools that enable folks to work in their desired field and support themselves and their loved ones.
